#For this code to work you need to install flask using either "pip install flask" or "sudo apt-get install python-flask"
#then you will be able to import the following things into your code 
#they are a bunch of functions that you will learn how to use, though not all today
from flask import Flask, render_template, session, request, redirect, url_for

#__name__ is a python variable that returns the name of the function that is running it
#__name__ will return "__main__" if the code is being run in the function it was originally written in
#This line initializes flask to run in this program
app = Flask(__name__)


#This code sets the next function to be executed when someone tries to access [yoururl].com/
@app.route('/')
def index():
    #This function is called index() because usually the defualt page of a website is referred to as the index

    #for the purposes of this demo we're going to simply redirect to /page1
    return redirect('/page1')


@app.route('/page1')
def page1():
    #This is Page1, we want to return the html of page1 as a website so it can be served to the client
    #The default location for html in flask is /templates so if you put an html file in the /templates directory
    #You can access it easily
    #This code returns the website stored in main.html 
    return render_template('main.html')


@app.route('/page2')
def page2():
    #This is basically the same as page1 but returns page2
    return render_template('other.html')


#This code checks that you are running this in the main function
#Someone else imports this code because they want to use a function you wrote, the following code won't execute
if __name__ == '__main__':
    #The secret key is an encryption key for the traffic to and from your website.
    #normally you would store it offline so people can't just see it
    #but this is a demo
    app.secret_key = 'DONT PUT THIS ON GITHUB IF YOU WANT SECURITY'
    
    #finally this line runs the code
    #The first parameter is the place you want to run it
    #  0.0.0.0 is localhost: your current machine
    #  127.0.0.0 is private localhost(I think) you can use this if you don't want people accessing your website
    #the port number is the port on your network card that you want to use to access the internet for this program
    #To view this website in action you go to "localhost:8000" in your browser
    app.run('0.0.0.0', port=8000)


#Ok That's all the code out of the way
#To execute the code just run python app.py
#This will run a networking server in the terminal
#To terminate the server press ctrl+c
#Keep in mind the server needs to be restarted for any changes you make to take effect
